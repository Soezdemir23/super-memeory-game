# Super Memory Game: Pepe Edition

## What is a memorygame?

It's basically a series of cards or pictures that shuffle each time you choose a card
if you manage to click all the cards that you didn't choose before, the difficulty increases
by raising the nuber of pictures to choose from.

## What was it built with?

+ Typescript
+ Tailwind
+ React
+ The informations feed from: https://rarepepewallet.com
+ for the shuffling algorithm, I used the Fisher-Yates algorithm that was provided by the author James Bubb

## What's left?

Probably a working loading screen while the cards are loading and move the footer content into the middle with a link to my profile.
